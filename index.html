            <h2>My passion</h2>
            
            <p id="passion">Ever since I was a little girl, I loved to draw, sketch, and create. I was fascinated by the world of fashion, and dreamed of becoming a designer someday. I admired the works of Harris Reed, who blended masculine and feminine aesthetics in his designs, and Florence Adepoju, who launched her own cosmetics brand after studying cosmetic science. I wanted to express my own style and vision, and make a positive impact on the society and the environment. I enrolled in a fashion design program at a prestigious school, where I learned from the best mentors and peers. I was ready to take on the challenges and opportunities of the fashion industry, and show the world what I could do. I was an aspiring teenage female designer, and this is my story.</p>
